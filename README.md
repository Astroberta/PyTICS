### PyTICS will soon be available as a public access package allowing for easy intercalibration of photometric data, applying a maximum likelihood ensemble photometry method. You can use the attatched jupyter notebook to run the algorithm, see below for the data you require. You can contact the author (rv40@st-andrews.ac.uk) if you'd like help with the intercalibration while the package is still being developed.

#### You currently need 6 arrays of data in this order:
#### Date (e.g. in MJD)
#### Filter Name
#### Unique Star identifier
#### Instrumental magnitude
#### Instrumental magnitude error
#### Unique telescope identifier

### The jupyter notebook shows example usage of the PyTICS algorithm for NGC 3783 taken with ten Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) 1-m telescopes for the u band 

### See attached the paper on the algorithm (Vieliute et al. submitted to RASTI)
